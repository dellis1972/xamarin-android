#### Application and library build and deployment

  * [Developer Community 1184573](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/1167082/xamarin-android-falsely-saying-that-resource-does.html):
    Xamarin Android falsely saying that Resource does not exist in the current context (CS0103).
    Duplicate `attr` elements in `declare-styleable`  styles were causing the design-time build
    system to crash. As a result the _Resource.designer.cs_ was not being updated.
