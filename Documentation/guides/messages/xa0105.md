# Compiler Warning XA0105

The Xamarin.Android build will emit a `XA0105` warning if it detects that one
of the referenced libraries or projects is using a `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)`
higher than the project being built. Using libraries which are targeting a
higher `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)` can cause unexpected results at runtime.
Especially when running on older devices.

The fix is to increase the `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)` for your project to 
be equal to or higher than the referenced library projects.
