# Compiler Error XA1004

There was an error opening {filename}. The file is probably corrupt.
Try deleting it and building again.

This usually happens if the download of the zip/aar file was incomplete.
The best thing to do is to try to delete the file and do a clean build.

If the problem persists raise an [issue](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/new).
