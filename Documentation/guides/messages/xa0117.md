# Compiler Warning XA0115

As the Android platform evolves certain apiLevels will be deprecated and
removed. Google publishes information about the market share of each
Android version [here](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/).

If you are seeing this warning it is because your `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)`
is set to a value which is likely to be deprecated in the near future.
To remove this warning update your `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)` to use
the latest stable platform. 

Your `android:minSdk` value can still use older versions of the android platform.
