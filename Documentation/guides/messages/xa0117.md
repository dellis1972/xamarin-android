# Compiler Warning XA0117

As the Android platform evolves certain versions will be deprecated and
removed. How we decide if a platform is deprecated largely depends on if
the [ndk](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/revision_history) is able to support the platform in question.
It also depends on if the Android Support Libraries support that platform.

If both of the above have removed support for a particular `apiLevel` is it
highly likely that it will be deprecated and removed from Xamarin.Android.

If you are seeing this warning it is because your `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)`
is set to a value which is likely to be deprecated in the near future.
To remove this warning update your `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)` to use
the latest stable platform. 

Your `android:minSdk` value can still use older versions of the android platform.
